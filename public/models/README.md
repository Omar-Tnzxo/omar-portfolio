# 3D Models Folder

## Instructions

1. Download the Earth model in **GLB format** (`.glb`)
2. Rename it to: `earth.glb`
3. Place it in this folder: `public/models/earth.glb`
4. Build and deploy

## Why GLB?

- ✅ Single file (no separate textures or bin files)
- ✅ Smaller file size
- ✅ Faster loading
- ✅ Works perfectly with Vite/Netlify
- ✅ All textures embedded

## File Size Recommendation

- Keep the GLB file under 10MB for best performance
- If larger, consider compressing it with: https://gltf.report/

## Current Status

- [ ] earth.glb - Place your GLB file here
